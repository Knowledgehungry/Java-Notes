# What is a switch case? 
- just like if condition, has multiple conditions with a certain number assigned to it

  Example :
  ```java
  int day = 1;
  switch(day) {
      case 1 :
        System.out.println("monday"); // will be executed if value of day is 1
        break; // exits from the case 
      case 2 :
        System.out.println("monday"); // will be executed if value of day is 2
        break; // if not written, the code of next case also gets executed
      default :
        System.out.println("wed - sun"); // will be executed if value of day is none of the given cases
  }

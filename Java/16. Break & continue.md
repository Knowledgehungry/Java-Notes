# What is break? 
- used to get out of a block of code

# What is continue? 
- used to continue a certain block of code

  Example :
  ```java
  int i = 0;
  while(true) { // true states that this loop will go on till infinity
      if(i == 3) {
          i++;
          continue; // stops the after code execution and again checks the condition
      }  
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
      if(i == 5) {
          break; // throws out of the while loop and stops execution
      }
  }


  OUTPUT :
  0
  1

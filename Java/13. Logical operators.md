# Logical operators
- used to analyze multiple statements
- types :

  - logical AND (&&)
    - if both the conditions are true then only the further code will be executed
    - even if one of the statements is false, the further code will not be executed

      Example :
      ```java
      int a = 80;
      int b = 60;
      if(a > 50 && b > 50) {
        System.out.println("Both the numbers are greater than 50"); // this statement will only be printed iff both the conditions are true
      }


      OUTPUT :
      Both the numbers are greater than 50 // both a and b are greater than 50

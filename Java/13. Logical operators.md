# Logical operators
- used to analyze multiple statements
- 3 types :

  - logical AND (&&)
    - if both the conditions are true then only the further code will be executed
    - even if one of the statements is false, the further code will not be executed

      Example :
      ```java
      int a = 80;
      int b = 60;
      if(a > 50 && b > 50) {
        System.out.println("Both the numbers are greater than 50"); // this statement will only be printed iff both the conditions are true
      }


      OUTPUT :
      Both the numbers are greater than 50 // both a and b are greater than 50


  - logical OR (||)
    - if one of the conditions is true then the further code will be executed

      Example :
      ```java
      int a = 40;
      int b = 60;
      if(a > 50 && b > 50) {
        System.out.println("Atleast one number is greater than 50"); // this statement will only be printed if any one of the conditions is true
      }


      OUTPUT :
      Atleast one number is greater than 50 // both a is greater than 50


  - logical NOT (!)
    - if a condition is true then it becomes false and if a condition is false then it becomes true

      Example :
      ```java
      boolean isAdult = false;
      if(!isAdult) {
        System.out.println("adult");
      }
      else {
        System.out.println("not adult");
      }


      OUTPUT :
      adult

    NOTE : Even if any == operators are not used in the if condition and only the variable is passed still the compiler considers it as == true

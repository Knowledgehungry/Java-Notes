# What is casting? 
- when something more than its capacity is given to it then there is some loss as the extra part goes to waste

  Example : If a glass of water is poured in a bucket, the bucket can hold the water but if the reverse is done then the glass
  cannot hold the water and there will be loss of water

- Implicit casting
  - like pouring a glass of water in the bucket
 
    Example :
    ``` java
    double price = 100.00;
    double finalPrice = price + 18;
    System.out.println(finalPrice);

# What are exceptions?
- are like errors but does not stop the whole program execution

  Example :
  ```java
  int[] marks = {97, 98, 95};
  try {
      System.out.println(marks[5]);
  }
  catch {
      // some code that is to be executed after catching exception
  }
  System.out.println("This is Krishna");


  OUTPUT :
  This is Krishna // if try and catch were not there in the code, then this line wouldn't have been executed
                  // the program would have given an exception

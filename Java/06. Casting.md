# What is casting? 
- when something more than its capacity is given to it then there is some loss as the extra part goes to waste

  Example : If a glass of water is poured in a bucket, the bucket can hold the water but if the reverse is done then the glass
  cannot hold the water and there will be loss of water

- 2 types 
  - Implicit casting - like pouring a glass of water in the bucket
   
      Example :
      ``` java
      double price = 100.00;
      double finalPrice = price + 18; // here an integer is added to a double and there is no loss of data as integer takes less no. of bits compared to double
      System.out.println(finalPrice);
  
  
      OUTPUT :
      118.00 -- the output is a double


  - Explicit casting - like pouring a bucket of water in the glass
  
      Example :
      ``` java
      double price = 100;
      int finalPrice = price + (int)18.00; /* here without (int) error would occur and it tells the compiler to take the double as an integer
                                            * (int) does not round off the double, instead it truncates the decimals */
      System.out.println(finalPrice);
  
  
      OUTPUT :
      118 -- the output is an integer

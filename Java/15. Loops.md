# What are loops?
- used to write that part of code which needs to be repeated
- 3 types of loops :
    - for loop - initialization is done while the conditions are specified in the loop

      Example :
      ```java
      for(i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
          System.out.println(i); // this statement will be executed until i becomes 100
      }


      OUTPUT :
      1
      2
      3
      .
      .
      .
      100
      

    - while loop - initialization is done before the loop
 
      Example :
      ```java
      int i = 1;
      while(i<=100) {
          System.out.println(i);
          i++;
      }
      
      OUTPUT :
      1
      2
      3
      .
      .
      .
      100


    - do-while loop - the code gets executed once and then the condition is checked
 
      Example :
      ```java
      int i = 100;
      do {
          System.out.println(i);
          i--;
      } while(i <= 100); // here semicolon(;) is used to tell the compiler that the code gets terminated here


      OUTPUT :
      100
      99
      98
      .
      .
      .
      1
      0

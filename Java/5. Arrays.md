# What are arrays? 
- collection of same set of elements
- given as : data_type[] array_name = new data_type[array_size];
- arrays with elements are defined as : data_type[] array_name = {element1, element2, ...};
- elements of array can be accessed using [] and index of that elemen

  NOTE : In Java, if a variable is not assigned any value, the by default value given to it is 0 and false for boolean

# Length of array
- length is a property of an array that gives its length
- given as : array_name.length
- parenthesis () are not given for arrays but only for variables

# How to sort an array?
- to use the sort function, Arrays class should be imported which sorts an array in ascending order

  Example : 
  ``` java
  com.package_name;
  
  import java.util.Arrays;
  
  public class File_name {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
  
        int [] marks = new int[3];
        marks[0] = 97;
        marks[1] = 98;
        marks[2] = 95;
  
        System.out.println(marks.length);
  
        System.out.println(marks[0]);
        Arrays.sort(marks);
        System.out.println(marks[0]);
      }
  }  

# 2D arrays
- arrays that are like matrices

  Example :
  ``` java
  int[][] marks = {{97, 98, 95}, {95, 90, 96}};
  System.out.println(marks[1][2]); // by giving the indexes in [] the elements can be accessed in 2D arrays
